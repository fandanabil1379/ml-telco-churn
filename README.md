# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

Welcome to the **Telco Customer Churn Prediction** repository! This project leverages data science and machine learning to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. By identifying customers at risk of leaving, businesses can implement targeted strategies to improve retention and reduce churn rates.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for telecommunication companies, directly impacting revenue and operational efficiency. This project builds a machine learning pipeline to:

- **Analyze customer behavior**
- **Identify factors contributing to churn**
- **Predict customers likely to churn**
- **Provide actionable insights to reduce churn**

The solution integrates feature engineering, model optimization, and evaluation techniques for a reliable and interpretable prediction system.
