Welcome to the **Telco Customer Churn Prediction** repository! This project harnesses the power of data science and machine learning to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry. By proactively identifying at-risk customers, businesses can implement data-driven strategies to enhance retention and minimize churn, ultimately driving growth and profitability.

## Project Overview

Customer churn poses significant challenges for telecommunications companies, affecting both revenue streams and operational efficiency. This project develops a comprehensive machine learning pipeline designed to:

- **Understand customer behavior patterns:** Explore and visualize data to uncover trends and insights related to customer actions and preferences.
- **Identify key drivers of churn:** Pinpoint the critical factors contributing to customer attrition, such as billing issues, service quality, or contract terms.
- **Predict at-risk customers:** Employ machine learning models to accurately predict customers who are likely to churn, enabling timely interventions.
- **Deliver actionable insights:** Provide clear, data-backed recommendations to reduce churn rates and improve customer satisfaction.

This solution integrates advanced feature engineering, model tuning, and robust evaluation metrics to ensure a scalable, interpretable, and reliable prediction framework.
